								<p>I decided to take this pathway because Iâ€™ve 
									heard that developers can work from home or anywhere, if they have a laptop or computer nearby.
									This type of work environment seems very convenient, and I want to be part of that environment. If I were to
									 work in the tech industry, I would prefer the location of the job close to home.
									Jobs in the tech industry have good pay 
									and the tech industry offers many jobs and opportunities for employment.
									<br/> <br/>
									My brother attends RMIT and is also studying Information Technology.
									He recommended that I should take this course. As my brother and I are 
									doing the same course, he can assist me with my studies. 
									He is part of what influenced me to study at RMIT.
									<br/> <br/>
									I am expecting to gain more knowledge about programming languages and the tech industry. 
									As information technology has many skills sets to offer 
									I want to find the skills that are most suited for myself, so I can specialise in them.
									However, I want to study things that are related to developing because my end goal is to have a remote job in 
									the tech industry.
