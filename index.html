											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi there! My name is Jerry Ng. I'm a first-year undergraduate student studying
											 Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia but my nationality is Malaysian. 
											At home, I speak a mix of English and Cantonese, mostly English. I used to have a pet turtle, 
											but after raising it for a few months I decided to release it into a local lake. I enjoy reading comics and 
										watching videos on YouTube. <br/> <br/> This is my Email: s3785404@student.rmit.edu.au <br/> Student Number: s3785404 </p>

										<span class="icon major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
										<p>Personality type: The Logistician 
										Individual traits:
											<br>
											Introverted – 67%
											<br>
											Observant – 54%
											<br>
											Thinking – 51%
											<br>
											Judging – 55%
											<br>
											Assertive – 54%
											<br>
										Role: Sentinel
										Strategy: Confident Individualism
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Online Learning Test</h3>
										<p>Auditory – 35% <br>
										Visual – 20% <br>
										Tactile – 45% <br>
										Tactile Learner 
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>The Big Five Personality Test</h3>
										<p>Openness – 54%
											<br>
										Conscientiousness – 75%
											<br>
										Extraversion – 37.5%
											<br>
										Agreeableness – 58%
											<br>
										Neuroticism – 44%
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>	<p>These test results show the way I learn and behave. The Myers Briggs test and the Big Five
										 Personality test are similar because they relate to personality. My results in the two personality
										 test are almost the same. The learning test displays my preference of learning style.
										 It shows that I prefer to learn practically rather than visually.
										As two of the test results display that I am an introverted person, 
										it could be a good suggestion to be more talkative for communication purposes in a team.
										When forming a team, these results can be used for recruiting members with the prefereable personality traits 
										and learning style.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						
								</header>
								<p class="content">The ideal job I have in mind is either remote or close to home. 
									The Car Next Door company is advertising a web development job that matches my ideal conditions for an ideal job. 
									The location of the job is convenient for me because it is remote which means communication and work can be done from home.
								<br>
									This job requires someone to have experience with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and CSS. 
									The company is also looking for someone who has worked in a similar industry for 3 or more years. 
									The salary for this job is over $100,000 per year which makes this offer seem very rewarding.
								<br>
									Currently, I am not qualified for this job because I lack the qualities that they are looking for
									such as experience in software development, debugging, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and CSS. 
									However, I am confident in my ability to devote myself to studying these skills and adapt to a new environment.
								<br>
									As this job requires someone with experience, I plan to take an internship program that relates to this type of job. 
									With the experience gained from an internship program, I’ll be able to qualify for some IT jobs as most require experience.

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p>Overview: Creating a website or smartphone application that lists the prices of products people want to buy, at the lowest price possible. 
										A comparison between the original price of the product and the lowest price is to show the user the amount of cash that can be saved. 
										This website is about purchasing a product at the lowest price possible and in the most convenient way. 
										This will be a website that is accessible by anyone who wants to use it and is free.
									<br/> <br/>
									Motivation: Products are not always listed at their lowest price in the market. 
										Trying to find a cheap price for a product that is usually expensive can be time consuming. 
										This project can assist in the search for cheap prices quick and easy.
									<br/> <br/>	
									Description: There will be a feature that shows the user the amount of cash being saved compared to the original price of the product. 
										Another possible feature could also be showing the user the most convenient way to acquire these products whether it be online or travelling.</p>
