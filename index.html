											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi there! My name is Jerry Ng. I'm a first-year undergraduate student studying
											 Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia but my nationality is Malaysian. 
											At home, I speak a mix of English and Cantonese, mostly English. I used to have a pet turtle, 
											but after raising it for a few months I decided to release it into a local lake. I enjoy reading comics and 
										watching videos on YouTube. <br/> <br/> This is my Email: s3785404@student.rmit.edu.au <br/> Student Number: s3785404 </p>

										<span class="icon major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
										<p>Personality type: The Logistician 
										Individual traits:
											<br>
											Introverted – 67%
											<br>
											Observant – 54%
											<br>
											Thinking – 51%
											<br>
											Judging – 55%
											<br>
											Assertive – 54%
											<br>
										Role: Sentinel
										Strategy: Confident Individualism
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Online Learning Test</h3>
										<p>Auditory – 35% <br>
										Visual – 20% <br>
										Tactile – 45% <br>
										Tactile Learner 
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>The Big Five Personality Test</h3>
										<p>Openness – 54%
											<br>
										Conscientiousness – 75%
											<br>
										Extraversion – 37.5%
											<br>
										Agreeableness – 58%
											<br>
										Neuroticism – 44%
										</p>
									</li>
									<br> <br>
										<p>These test results show the way I learn and behave. The Myers Briggs test and the Big Five
										 Personality test are similar because they relate to a personality test. My results in the two personality
										 test are almost the same. The learning test displays my preference of learning style.
										 It shows that I prefer to learn practically rather than visually.
										As two of the test results display that I am an introverted person, 
										it could be a good suggestion to be more talkative for communication purposes in a team.
										When forming a team, these results can be used for recruiting members with the prefereable personality traits 
										and learning style.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						
								</header>
								<p class="content">The ideal job I have in mind is either remote or close to home. 
									The Car Next Door company is advertising a web development job that matches my ideal conditions for an ideal job. 
									The location of the job is convenient for me because it is remote which means communication and work can be done from home.
								<br>
									This job requires someone to have experience with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and CSS. 
									The company is also looking for someone who has worked in a similar industry for 3 or more years. 
									The salary for this job is over $100,000 per year which makes this offer seem very rewarding.
								<br>
									Currently, I am not qualified for this job because I lack the qualities that they are looking for
									such as experience in software development, debugging, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and CSS. 
									However, I am confident in my ability to devote myself to studying these skills and adapt to a new environment.
								<br>
									As this job requires someone with experience, I plan to take an internship program that relates to this type of job. 
									With the experience gained from an internship program, I’ll be able to qualify for some IT jobs as most require experience.

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p>Overview: <br>
										Creating a mobile app that can act as a controller for consoles like the PlayStation 4 or XBOX. 
										This application can be used wireless from the console and will have the same functions as a controller would.
										There will have to be a link between the phone and the console, so maybe the same application will have to be 
										downloaded onto the console. The app is free of charge.
									<br/> <br/>
									Motivation: <br>
										If someone is looking for a spare controller or do not have the cash to afford one, this application is 
										the solution to those problems. An application that has access to multiple types of controllers will be useful. 
										You will never need to buy another controller ever again. This application is all you will need to use as 
										a controller for any console.
									<br/> <br/>	
									Description: <br>
										The application will be able to hold multiple types of controllers. 
										For specific games such as Tekken or Street Fighter, an arcade stick can be added as one of the controllers 
										in the app. When buttons are pressed there can be vibration effects and these vibrations should have an 
										option to be disabled. Adjustments of the user interface can also be another feature for the application so 
										users can have their preferred layout. The size and location of the controls on screen should be an option for 
										users to adjust. Sound effects are not necessary for this application unless it is wanted. 
										A list of the types of controllers should also be in the application.
									<br/> <br/>
									Tools and Technologies: <br>
										A laptop or desktop is needed to use software and write code for the application. Software such as 
										Android Studio can be used to create apps. 
									<br/> <br/>
									Skills: <br>
										To make an app, knowledge of Java is needed. The software to make an app can be found on the internet. Software such as Android 
										studio can be used to create apps. Knowledge about Java can also be accessed on the internet. A major skill for this 
										app will be the design of each of the controllers. Database skills will also be needed to store the types of 
										controllers.
									<br/> <br/>
									Outcome: <br>
										If this project becomes successful, everyone with a phone will be able to use every type of controller for free 
										through this application. Although this app is free, it may cause conflict in the market because real controllers 
										cost cash.
